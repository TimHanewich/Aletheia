<p class="btxt">Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities based on material, nonpublic information about the company. In the eyes of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), an *insider* is considered a director, officer, or major shareholder (greater than 10% ownership).</p>
<p class="btxt">Since insider trading gives insiders a decisive competitive edge over comparatively non-informed traders, there are laws and regulations in place to prevent abuse. In the United States, the Securities Exchange Commission is the governing body who regulates and enforces these anti-manipulation laws. One of the primary methods the SEC uses to regulate insider trading is requiring every insider to report their trades (buys, sells, grants, transfers, etc.) to the SEC through <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/forms-3-4-5.pdf">Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5 filings</a>.</p>
<p class="btxt">Thousands of insider transactions are reported to the SEC each day. These filings are publicly available at the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">SEC's website</a> but are obscure, difficult to access, and not the easiest to interpret.</p>
